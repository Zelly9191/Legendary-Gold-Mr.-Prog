Legendary Gold Mr.Prog
----------------------

This mod simply changes it so that when you encounter the Water God Comp Gold Prog, he will give you all of his rewards (for the current difficulty) at once. Now, regardless of RNG, if you can find him, you will still get all those juicy exclusive Chip codes.

This can still be done the full 5 times per playthrough, allowing you to get a full set of 5 of each chip he gives you.


This mod is available in two flavors, with minor differences.

-Fair: This version keeps the Zenny and Bug Frag rewards at their original values. ie, for playthrough 1, 5000 Zenny and 5 Bug Frags per encounter.

-OP: This version adds an extra zero to the end of the Bug Frag and Zenny totals. ie, for playthrough 1, 50,000 Zenny and 50 Bug Frags per encounter.
